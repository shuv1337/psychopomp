# Psychopomp

Code-first motion graphics in Rust. One authored scene can become a native,
interruptible presentation or a shutter-sampled video.

The project was previously named Kinograph; a psychopomp is a guide that leads
souls between worlds, as these scenes lead a viewer from one state to the next.

Psychopomp is an early prototype, not a general-purpose scene graph. Its examples
explore stable code edits, teaching diagrams, typography, and narrated explainers.
Motion is sampled at arbitrary times; reversing a transition preserves its
current position and velocity instead of restarting an animation.

## Run a presentation

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo run -p psychopomp-interactive-showcase
cargo run --release -- plan present target/interactive-showcase/deck.json --theme original
```

This opens a four-slide deck of code reveals and Effect Tasks. **' / Shift+'**
changes slides; **← / →** changes steps; **R** replays; **P** pauses; **S** slows motion.

You need a recent Rust toolchain, a working `wgpu` adapter, and a desktop display.
The prototype has been exercised on macOS/Metal. CommitMono is bundled
(`assets/fonts`, SIL OFL) and compiled in, so text renders identically on every
machine; installed fonts only supply glyphs CommitMono lacks, such as CJK or emoji.

For the typography, table, and component showroom, see
[Scene Programs and presentations](SCENE_PLANS.md).

## Export the same scene

With FFmpeg and `libx264` on `PATH`:

```sh
cargo run --release -- plan render target/interactive-showcase/task-lifecycle.json output/task-lifecycle.mp4 --range 3..6 --theme original
```

The range samples the original scene clock, so cutting into a transition does
not restart it. Exports choose their theme explicitly; native preferences do not
silently change exported pixels. Generated plans and media belong in ignored
`target/` and `output/` directories.

## Make a narrated explainer

`scenes/pr-walkthrough` is a complete narrated reel: sequence diagrams replay broken
and fixed behavior, and editors animate each change as a diff. See
[Make A Narrated Explainer Reel](SCENE_PLANS.md#make-a-narrated-explainer-reel).

```sh
cargo run -p psychopomp-pr-walkthrough
cargo run --release -- plan render scenes/pr-walkthrough/pr-walkthrough.reel.json output/pr-walkthrough.mp4 --theme opencode
```

For a **caption-only, silent** example, [Herdr red panes](scenes/herdr-red-panes/README.md)
replays three incorrect status reports, then animates the real plugin changes:

```sh
cargo run -p psychopomp-herdr-red-panes
cargo run --release -- plan render target/herdr-red-panes/reel.json output/herdr-red-panes.mp4 --theme opencode
```

## Change intent, motion, or pixels in the right place

A **Scene Program** is a small Rust executable under `scenes/`. It writes a
**Scene Plan**: JSON containing identities, destinations, timing, and recipe data.
The renderer prepares that plan once, then samples it for either delivery.

```text
scenes/*                         authored meaning, destinations, choreography
    ↓ Scene Plan
crates/psychopomp                  identity, validation, tracks, retargeting, time
    ↓ typed preflight and resource preparation
crates/psychopomp-render           measured typography, recipes, sampled pixels
    ├─ native presentation       Playback, window and worker scheduling
    └─ video export              temporal sampling, readback and FFmpeg
```

Share a rule when two real callers need the same behavior. Keep recipe-specific
layout, identity, and motion choices visible. A Grid product, an editor line,
and a sequence row are not interchangeable just because each has a key.

## Verify a change

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

For rendering or choreography changes, also inspect targeted frames and
transitions, including interrupted navigation. Passing tests is not aesthetic
approval.
